### Splastic
- Using ocean current data and non-probabilistic lagrangian physics ocean current models, we can find the likely source of trash in oceans, as well as the likely path ocean pollution will take.
- We credit the use of Parcels (https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels)
*Lange, M. and E van Sebille (2017) Parcels v0.9: prototyping a Lagrangian Ocean Analysis framework for the petascale age. Geoscientific Model Development, 10, 4175-4186. https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2017-167*

### SeaVision
- Using satellite images, we detect large patches of plastics in oceans.
- We utilize Planet's PlanetScope satellites (8 bands, 3m x 3m spatial resolution) and apply a random forest algorithm 


Our goal is to integrate both technologies to create a novel technique for combating ocean pollution.
